# Prototype: the tuneprog-to-trackerprog pipeline as compiler passes

`deity_informant/trackerprog/universal.py` is an interpreter, a trackerprog is
its program, and a tune's certified tick is that interpreter specialised on one.
The lift is the inverse, and this states it as compiler passes: six levels, each
a representation the next pass consumes, and from L2 on each level is **itself a
trackerprog** — the guarded `all: True` row list at a `{stream}` phase is the
schema's most general construct — so it renders on the unchanged player and
carries the same certificate.  That is translation validation for every pass:
`passes/ir.py`'s `validate(before, after, horizon)` renders both levels and
compares their write lists, and no pass of this prototype is committed without it.

## 1. The levels

| level | representation | pass | module | lines |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| L0 | S4 IR + S6 names + the image | the tuneprog pipeline | — | — |
| L1 | structured tick: one procedure, callees inlined, runs and sibling copies rerolled, the voice loop and its indices explicit | inlining, rerolling, mem2reg | `passes/l1_structure.py` (+ `callee.py`, #351's own, restored) | 279 (+270) |
| L2 | phase-normal form: the voice body cut at the fetch regions and the edge writes into phases, each a predicated row list, plus the tick's own pre and post lists | region formation, if-conversion | `passes/l2_phases.py` | 366 |
| L3 | typed PNF: every cell typed by the slot lattice, every table by its kind | type inference over a finite lattice | `passes/l3_roles.py` | 232 |
| L4 | materialised PNF: the fetch replayed into §3.6 events with fields, the clock the player's, the walk the score's own play lists; the residual is the row program | partial evaluation | `passes/l4_specialise.py` | 260 |
| L5 | selected object: runs of predicated rows covered by construct expansions with a size cost; what no construct covers stays as rows | BURS-style covering | `passes/l5_select.py`, `passes/expand.py` | 255, 298 |
| L6 | canonical trackerprog: adjacent streams merged, cells propagated and their writes dead, implied guard terms dropped, names canonical | scalar optimisation | `passes/l6_canon.py` | 336 |

`passes/ir.py` (103) is the level object and the validation; `tools/trackerprog_passes.py`
(123) runs L4–L6 over a bound object.  New non-test code: **2,529 lines**, 2,136
of it written here and 393 restored or driving.  Hermetic coverage of all of it,
`pytest tests/trackerprog -m "not hvsc"`: **95 %**.

---

## 2. The idioms, level by level

Each is a fragment in the S4 IR, built by hand, named by the family that forced
it, and taken through the one pass with no branch on a family —
`test_no_pass_of_the_pipeline_names_a_family` greps the pass modules for all nine
family names and finds none.  Every fragment that changes the program is
validated against the level before it.

### L1 — `tests/trackerprog/test_l1_idioms.py`, 12 green

| idiom | family | |
| --- | --- | --- |
| a callee inlined where it stands | GoatTracker 2 | green |
| a run of three calls with a stepping argument rerolled into the loop it closes | Walker, Hubbard | green |
| unrolled voice copies at a stride rerolled into one pass over that stride | SID Wizard, Hubbard | green |
| the voice loop and its induction variables explicit | all nine | green |
| a per-voice array at a stride, and the record S6 splits at it | GoatTracker 2 | green |
| a fused tuning region with state past it | Hubbard | green |
| a split tuning of two byte tables | SID Wizard, GoatTracker 2 | green |
| the first call's own blocks peeled as a prologue | GoatTracker 2, SID Wizard | green |

The reroller is one rule: a chain of blocks whose statements are equal up to an
arithmetic progression of their own constants is one turn of a loop, with one
index a step and a counter that closes it.  A pass rerolled at the voice stride,
as many turns as there are voices, has a voice index like the loop it came from.

### L2 — `test_l2_idioms.py`, 8 green

| idiom | family | |
| --- | --- | --- |
| segments at the fetch region and at the edge writes, the commits placed | Hubbard | green |
| the act is the row: two rows each writing `AD` stay two acts | SID Wizard | green |
| a block's guard path is the row's own predicate | all nine | green |
| a fetch region that runs ahead of the boundary it stages for | GoatTracker 2, SID Wizard, JCH | green |
| a block before the voices and one after: the tick's own channel | Follin | green |
| the flush as the tick's own first act | GoatTracker 2, JCH, defMON | green |

If-conversion is by **predicate cell**: a block that decides a term and then
moves a cell that term reads has no channel for the value it decided on, so the
decision is a cell assigned where the block makes it, and every row it guards
reads that cell.  A block the tick does not reach assigns nothing and the terms
that lead to it are cells of the same kind, so no reset is needed.  A join no
path folds is #351's `planall` finished: each path raises a flag where it stands
and the tick clears them once.  A register a channel row names is one entry of
`globals.commit`, staged in a cell of its own where the row computed it; a
per-voice cell a channel row writes is every voice's (§3.6's `all`).

### L3 — `test_l3_idioms.py`, 10 green

| idiom | family | |
| --- | --- | --- |
| the reserved cells typed from their uses (`note`, `ins`, `rowsleft`, `orderpos`) | all nine | green |
| a stream cursor over a table | defMON, JCH, GoatTracker 2 | green |
| the order's own cursor | all nine | green |
| the clock as a countdown with a reset clause | GoatTracker 2, JCH | green |
| the clock as a counter its own clauses zero | SID Wizard | green |
| a cell the fetch writes and another phase reads: a staging cell | SID Wizard | green |
| the image's own halves typed `shadow` | GoatTracker 2, JCH, defMON | green |
| T1's own cell typed `acc` | every family that has one | green |
| the tables typed by the plane that named them | all nine | green |

Typing renames and states; it moves no value, so the level renders exactly what
the level before it rendered, which the tests assert as well as validate.

### L4 — `test_l4_idioms.py`, 8 green

| idiom | family | |
| --- | --- | --- |
| a byte-decoding fetch specialised to the event fields it stored | Hubbard | green |
| a second packing of the same byte through the same path | GoatTracker 2 | green |
| a third packing through the same path again | — | green |
| the row's own length is the clock the player steps | all nine | green |
| a store the fetch made is the event of the visit that made it | JCH | green |
| the order the horizon walked as the score's own play list (`play`, `jump`) | Follin, Galway | green |
| a cursor with `hold`, `next` and `jump` specialised to a stream record | defMON, JCH, GT2 | **not prototyped** (§6) |
| a small decoder unrolled to its rows over a horizon | Blackbird | **not prototyped** (§6) |

### L5 — `test_l5_idioms.py`, 15 green, and §3

| idiom | |
| --- | --- |
| a sweep run covered by the record it expands to | green |
| a slide run with a direction covered by its two arms | green |
| a reload run covered by the policy it is | green |
| a gated run covered with the arm the gate writes | green |
| a run that produces the value it came in with is `emit: entry` | green |
| a run no construct expands to stays a row | green |
| every family's record costs less than the run of rows it covers | green |
| the covering takes the longest run a construct expands to | green |
| the record and the rows it covers render the same | green |

### L6 — `test_l6_idioms.py`, 6 green

| idiom | |
| --- | --- |
| adjacent streams of one tick are one stream | green |
| a cell whose reads are an expression over state no row moves is spent | green |
| a guard term the clock's boundary implies is dropped | green |
| a guard term over two constants is worth what it is | green |
| a cell named by the register its sole reader writes | green |
| the level leaves every one of the thirty hand objects no bigger and certified | green, 30 of 30 |

---

## 3. The round trip, over the thirty hand objects

`tests/trackerprog/test_l5_roundtrip.py`, generated from the poison registry's
own builds; the counts are written to `out/passes/roundtrip.json`.

| | acc | prelude | on_note | row | flush | reset | producer | total |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| instances | 296 | 126 | 169 | 140 | 146 | 12 | 301 | **1,190** |
| expandable | 261 | 126 | 169 | 20 | 146 | 12 | 301 | **1,035** |
| `expand(select(expand(c))) == expand(c)` | 261 | 126 | 169 | 20 | 146 | 12 | 301 | **1,035** |
| `select(expand(c)) == c`, canonically | 261 | 126 | 169 | 20 | 146 | 12 | 301 | **1,035** |
| faithful under the hermetic snippet | 240 | — | — | — | — | — | — | **240 of 240 armable** |

Nothing failed: `failed` is empty.  21 of the 261 expandable records could not be
*armed* under the snippet — the arm that binds their numbers is a row's own
command, whose payload a one-phase snippet has no row for — and they are counted
by build (`gt2-je-suis-linus` 6, `gt2-do-it-again` 6, `commando-song2` 2,
`commando-song3` 2, `sw-emomyst` 2, `sw-end-of-the-world` 2,
`blackbird-quintessence` 1).

The canonical form is stated, not assumed: an expansion is a run of rows, so it
carries no annotation (`rank`, `scope`, `target`, `note`), no interval to assert
(`bound`, which the selection derives from the mask the store writes through),
no `rate` of 1, no width a delta never masks by, no `cell` for a record that
only gates, and `step_when` and `delta_when` are one guard where the gate has no
false arm.  A produce of one byte is its own low half.

**155 instances have no expansion into rows at all**, each named by its own form:

| form | count | why |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `{stream}` step | 43 | the rows are the stream's own and the step names it |
| `{commands}` step | 28 | the row language has no channel for the event |
| `{note}` step | 27 | the same |
| `{ins}` step | 22 | the same |
| `gate` under a `step_when` | 11 | a row cannot state the negation of a guard |
| `reflect` | 7 | the turn reads the value the row writes |
| `clamp` | 6 | taking a pitch is one named operation and no assignment (§3.1) |
| `beyond` | 3 | no row states what lies past the tuning |
| `repeat` | 3 | the row language has no loop |
| `trap` | 3 | no row states an arm the horizon never takes |
| `reflect-complement` | 2 | the turn reads the value the row writes |

This is the pipeline's own boundary, measured: **a covering can never select a
construct whose expansion is not a run of rows**, and eleven of the schema's
forms are of that kind.

---

## 4. The synthetic program, end to end

`tests/trackerprog/_pipeline.py` is one tune in the S4 IR carrying, at once, a
run of unrolled sibling blocks the structuring rerolls into the pass over the
voices it is; a voice loop with two indices (its own number and its base in the
register file); a countdown clock the row reloads; a fetch one clock step ahead
of the boundary it stages for; a byte-decoding fetch with a wrap that steps the
order; a 25-register image and its flush; a cursor over a wave table; and a
two-armed slide with a bounce that turns its direction cell.

`tests/trackerprog/test_pipeline.py`, 300 ticks, 7,500 writes:

| pass | ticks | writes | identical | divergence |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| L0 → L1 | 300 | 7,500 | yes | none |
| L1 → L2 | 300 | 7,500 | yes | none |
| L2 → L3 | 300 | 7,500 | yes | none |
| L3 → L4 | 300 | 7,500 | yes | none |
| L4 → L5 | 300 | 7,500 | yes | none |
| L5 → L6 | 300 | 7,500 | yes | none |

| level | xz | streams | rows | cells |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| L2 | 1,328 | 13 | 151 | 17 |
| L3 | 1,332 | 13 | 151 | 17 |
| L4 | 1,412 | 12 | 147 | 17 |
| L5 | 1,412 | 12 | 147 | 17 |
| L6 | 1,388 | 11 | 146 | 16 |

What each level derived, from `out/passes/pipeline.json`: L1 rerolled 1 chain and
found a 5-block prologue; L2 cut four segments (`prelude` 1 · `row` 3 ·
`machine` 5 · `machine` 1), raised 8 predicate cells and 3 join flags and read
the flush's 25 registers; L3 typed `rowsleft`, `ins`, `orderpos`, `note`, two
cursors and three shadow halves, and called the clock a divider stepping −1; L4
materialised 16 events over 4 patterns and made the clock `meta.tempo`; L5's
covering found two records and the object's own size declined them (1,412 against
1,584); L6 merged one stream and spent the predicate `phead`.

## 5. Commando song 1, from the binding to L6

The binding of [prototype-lifter.md](prototype-lifter.md) is L3 with one L4
shape — the score already materialised — so `tools/trackerprog_passes.py` takes
its object through L5 and L6.

```
tools/tuneprog_trackerprog.py --out out/lift-b6/commando-song1 --sid <resolved> --certify
  commando-song1: 11780 ticks, 26 rows, 3 accs, 32 patterns, 572 events,
                  0 hints, 5 refusals, xz 3608, divergence None, 9.2 s
tools/trackerprog_passes.py   --out out/lift-b6/commando-song1 --sid <resolved> --certify
  commando-song1 L4: 17 streams, 26 rows, 3 accs, 18 cells, xz 3608, divergence None
  commando-song1 L5: 17 streams, 26 rows, 3 accs, 18 cells, xz 3608, divergence None
  commando-song1 L6: 16 streams, 26 rows, 3 accs, 18 cells, xz 3588, divergence None
  commando-song1: covered ['machine1_acc4'], selected none,
                  covering xz [3608, 3688], merged 1, propagated none, 0.6 s
```

**0 divergences over 11,780 ticks at every level.**  `tools/trackerprog_sizes.py
--object` puts the L6 object at **3,588 — 1.41×** the tune's 2,548-byte load
band, against the hand transliteration's 3,464 and 1.36×: **3.6 % over the
hand**, inside the 10 % the acceptance asked for.

Selection found one record in the machine's rows — a counter the pulse sweep
steps — and the object's own size declined it: the record repeats a four-term
guard that the one row it covers states once, and stating it costs 80 bytes of
`xz`.  The size cost is the object's, not the run's.

**The hand's seven, and which of them a covering could ever reach**
(`out/passes/commando-records.json`, from `expand.acc_why` over the hand object):

| record | reachable | the form the catalogue lacks a row for |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `pulse_run` | yes | — (and the binding already states it, from T1) |
| `slide` | yes | — (and the binding already states it, from T1) |
| `vibrato` | no | `repeat`: the row language has no loop |
| `pulse_bounce` | no | `reflect`: the turn reads the value the row writes |
| `drum` | no | `gate` under a `step_when`: a row cannot state the negation |
| `skydive` | no | `trap`: no row states an arm the horizon never takes |
| `arpeggio` | no | `beyond`: no row states what lies past the tuning |

So the four the binding leaves as rows are exactly four whose §5 form has no
expansion into rows.  **No covering, however good, can select them**; what stands
between this object and the hand's is not the selector but four missing row
forms, each named above.

## 6. What the prototype does not do, and the bounds it hit

Stated as findings, not as work in progress.

| | |
| --- | --- |
| L4: a cursor with `hold`, `next` and `jump` specialised into a §3.3 stream record (defMON, JCH, GT2) | not prototyped. The cursors are named in the level's own facts (`out/passes/pipeline.json`, `cursors`) and left as the rows that walk them |
| L4: a small decoder unrolled to its rows over a horizon (Blackbird) | not prototyped, for the same reason: it is the cursor specialisation |
| L4: the order's `call`, `ret`, `mark` and `loop` (Follin, Galway) | not prototyped. The walk becomes `play` steps and a `jump` end; which opcode a step is, is a recognition the level does not make |
| L2: an inner loop of the voice's own pass | one block is one row, so a block a tick runs several times is stated once. The synthetic program and the fragments have none |
| L1, L2 and L3 have not been run on a real tune | the fragments and the synthetic program of §4 are what they are proven on. §5 takes Commando from the binding, which is already L3 with one L4 shape, so the three passes below it were never asked for a family's own 84-block tick |
| bound: `l2_phases.py` 366, `l6_canon.py` 336 | over the 300 a module was given, by 66 and 36 |
| bound: 2,529 lines of new non-test code | over the 2,000 given, by 529; 270 of it is #351's `callee.py` restored verbatim and 123 the tool |

Two levels change no value at all and are validated as such: L3 renames and
states, and L6's four passes are each conservative — a stream a cursor or a
re-point names keeps its rows and their numbers, a cell read anywhere but the
rows one tick runs is not propagated, and a naming that makes the object bigger
is not taken.  That conservatism is what carries all thirty hand objects through
L6 with the render identical and the size non-increasing.
