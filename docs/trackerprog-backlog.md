# trackerprog — review and backlog

Review of [prototype-trackerprog.md](prototype-trackerprog.md) against the
documents it cites and the code it assumes, and the work that enables it,
scoped module by module against `deity_informant/tuneprog/` and the recert
prints under `out/recert-main/`. Sizes follow
[tuneprog-backlog.md](tuneprog-backlog.md) §2: small ≤ 1 day of one agent,
medium ≤ 1 stage, large = a stage with a prototype.

## 1. What already holds

| doc assumption | state |
| --- | --- |
| §6 input set `tuneprog.S4.json`, `tuneprog.S6.json`, `certificate.json` | all emitted by `pipeline.stage_front`/`stage_print` (`pipeline.py:280,446,357`); `ir.Tuneprog.load` reloads S4 in 0.01 s; S6 has no loader — consumers read the JSON and join on `regions[].id` (`ghidra_facts.py:228`) |
| §6 roles `freq_table cursor timer acc sid_image voice_map` | all exist (`recover.py:231-327`, `facts.py:288-302`); also `table ptr counter phase per_copy`. `state`/`init_constant` are region *kinds*, not roles |
| §7 "cell histories over `interp`, no tracer change" | prototyped: `verify.Verifier` + `np.frombuffer(M.m)` sampled after each `_one()`; GT2 8,236 ticks, 28 named state regions, 3.8 s, 0 divergences, 2.1 MB |
| §2 "grid.py already frames the comparison" | four reductions exist over one log: `grid.grid` level-per-frame with a PW-nibble mask (`grid.py:34-55`), `ghidra_facts._tick_writes` ordered changes unmasked (`ghidra_facts.py:153-181`), `verify._compare` raw ordered incl. mirrors (`verify.py:267-279`), `period.Samples` raw bytes (`period.py:59-67`) |
| §6 T0 "slice `io` stores back" | `irwalk.accessors` has no `cls`; join on `Rgn.kind`. GT2 has **one** `io` store — the ghost flush; the producers are 21 stores into the `sid_image` region, bridged today by naming (`names.image`), not dataflow (no memory SSA, `ssa.py:3`) |
| §6 T1 "`ranges.py` supplies the interval, `gated.py` reads the reflect" | **false on every exemplar**: `ranges.expr_range` bails to width on any self-referential `+`/`-` (`ranges.py:44-49`), and `gated.diamonds` needs one same-name `Let` per arm (`gated.py:34-37`) — no reflect site in GT2/Commando/JCH/SW has that shape. `facts.update_role` (`facts.py:288`) is the seed: self-reference + constant delta, no bound/policy/rate/phase |
| §6 T2 "cursor roles delimit tables" | `facts.index`/`cellindex` (`facts.py:114-125`) is the fact, but it reaches `role = cursor` only for scalar regions ≤ 8 elements (`recover.py:311`), never record-split fields (`views._named_fields`, `views.py:195-203`), and is **not serialised** (`recover.py:67-85`). Every family's score cursors are record fields (`rec[x/7].f00/f03`, `voice_3[v].timer_2`, `rec[x/7+3].timer_3`) — none is named `cursor` in any S6 today |

## 2. Review: claims against their sources

Confirmed as cited (not repeated here): the anatomy license, the one-object
row, Hubbard's write order and `$D401` overwrite, the 12-TET tables, GT2 `$FF`
jumps, defMON 8×/frame, Galway 8-deep stack, Walker LFOs, SW owner voice and
`CKBDTRK`, JCH track-0 filter, `INC $15DD`, the multispeed entry, the
Commando aperiodicity, cert numbers, 51/51.

| § | claim | what the source says |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 2 | GT2 ghost flush "low-to-high" | high-to-low: `for r in 24..0` (anatomy:766, `LDX #$18 … DEX`) |
| 2 | AD/SR share the gate's write-order sensitivity per anatomy §1.3 | §1.3 names gate 1→0→1 and TEST 1→0 only; the rate-counter point is about the ADSR delay bug across notes (anatomy:126-156). An extension, state it as one |
| 3.2 | Blackbird = 4×-resolution table | two overlapped byte arrays, quarter-semitones by **summing two entries** (anatomy:146-149); not liftable as `[u16; 4N]` |
| 3.2 | GT2 `FREQ_LO/HI` 91 entries | 96 (`$14E3`/`$1543`; anatomy:742) |
| ~~3.3~~ | ~~JCH `rec6` pulse `[init, Δ, dir\|frames, next]`, `rec7` filter — shapes swapped~~ | **struck, the row was wrong**: `rec6` *is* the 4-column pulse program and `rec7` the 3-column filter one (prototype-jch:82, 106-107; `jch-guldkorn-intro/tuneprog.md:527-546` reads all seven columns). The doc's only fault was writing "four column programs" for two programs of 4 and 3 columns; W0 states both counts |
| 3.3 | `timer_4` compare is the GT2 wavetable hold | `timer_4` is a field name with no role (prototype-goattracker:84); the print confirms the mechanism (`gt2-je-suis-linus/tuneprog.md:564-569`, not `:551`) but the cited doc does not |
| 3.5 | hard restart is one fixed shape | SW 1.6 writes AD,SR and 1.9 SR,AD (anatomy:1232-1233); Blackbird has no TEST (anatomy:133-135); Walker/Galway do intra-tick gate/TEST edges (anatomy:138-140, 214) — observable under §2 rule 1, inexpressible in `{early, ad, sr, first_ctrl}` |
| 3.7 | `CKBDTRK` is a `tablestep` term | it adds an **absolute** `FREQ[$E + idx]` entry (prototype-sidwizard:110-118), not a difference |
| 5 | Commando pulse run = 16-bit wrap | 8-bit add on pw-lo (commando-floor:222-224); and its carry is **live from the vibrato block** (`commando-song1/tuneprog.md:394`) — `delta const(k)` refuses it |
| 5 | GT2 depth `T1851[y] & $7F` | that is `speedcmp`; depth is the right byte (anatomy:876) |
| 5 | `p_109E`, `p_10AB`, `p_10F5`, `T1864`, `portaval`, `pulsedir`, `pulsedelay` | names absent from the cited prototype docs (they are print/anatomy names; commando-floor uses `porta`, `pwdir`, `pwdelay`); `$10AB` in the anatomy is an SMC immediate |
| 5 | Hubbard porta = tone portamento, clamp(pitch[target]) | no target: free ±step ramp (commando-floor:236-238); it is the "free slide" row |
| 5 | pulse-sweep state is instrument-scoped | `pw` yes; `pwdir`/`pwdelay` are per-voice (commando-floor:226-228) |
| 5 | skydive | dead in the exemplar (`trap 'untaken'`, commando-floor:247) |
| 9.3 | "measured like §6.2" + `xz -9e` | §6.2's six are tokens/lines/statements/blocks/header rows/data rows; `xz` is §8.3. Architecture §11 requires §6.2's six verbatim |
| 1 | 91.6 % "voice-stride state appears" | 91.6 % weighted of tunes with ≥ 50 % voice-like indexed sites (arch:**1009**, not 940); the summary line at arch:1027 says 90 % |
| 10 | note-95 overrun reads two bytes past the table | the certified case is pitch 104 ×25, reading `voice[].ctrl` and `pwdir` — **play-written state** (commando-floor:301-310), not materialisable as `pitch` |
| 3–5 | Galway, Walker, Blackbird evidence | prose-only families; none certified (arch §9.2) |

## 3. Review: internal

| id | inconsistency |
| --- | --- |
| I1 | §2 last-wins on 16-bit registers vs §4 `freq = pitch[…] + Σ accs`: Hubbard's vibrato/porta/drum/arp each store `freq` independently, the arp absolute — a sum cannot reproduce the observable §2 defines, on the exemplar §9 accepts seventh |
| I2 | §2 compares the ordered ctrl/AD/SR list; §4 `commit(v)` never states the order between hard-restart prelude, stream `set`, `gate(mask)` and note-on, and calls voice order immaterial. The player does not pin the one thing the certificate compares (SW 1.6 vs 1.9 is the test case) |
| I3 | `rate` is steps-per-tick on streams (§3.3) and every-k-ticks on `Acc` (§5); §4 implements neither; §10's multispeed question needs a divider on streams/tempo, which the schema lacks |
| I4 | one global `tempo.step()` (§4) vs `set_tempo` per pattern, SW per-track tempo, GT2 per-voice `F` and `funktempo` |
| I5 | `Order` grammar has no volume/tempo field, but its "degenerate case" is SW pattern/transpose/vol/tempo |
| I6 | `arm(acc_id, param)`: `Acc` has no `param`; GT2's vibrato param selects speedcmp *and* depth; GT2 commands 5/6 (ADSR from a row), 8/9/A (re-point a stream), Follin `$85` raw cross-voice register lists — all `command residue` under §8 on "all six complete" exemplars |
| I7 | §3.2 "never a raw frequency" vs §5 `delta const` on `freq` targets |
| I8 | §5 "every modulation is an Acc" includes two stream rows (arp, tremolo); `target vol, scope voice` is unrealisable (`$D418` is global) |
| I9 | §4 `clamp(note …)` vs §10 "materialise the overrun" — two edge rules, neither works for Commando |
| I10 | `complete` ⇒ "the score closes": `jch-knob-at-night` and Follin song 1 are `complete` with `period: 1`; §6's period-bounded materialisation would emit one row |
| I11 | Commando carries `inputs_pinned == ticks` (11,780); §8's `external input` refuses it as written |
| I12 | defMON is evidence for §3.3/§3.5/§5 and absent from §9's acceptance list |
| I13 | single-family rows against §1's rule: `gate.timer` (GT2), `set_tempo(stream)` (SW), `scope instrument` (Hubbard) |
| I14 | §2 says `compared` records the dropped cross-register order; the example carries only the kept classes |
| I15 | GT2's ctrl/AD/SR order *is* the ghost flush order — the idiom §2 excludes; the trackerprog must state which order it emits |

The schema decisions I1–I3, I6, I10–I11 gate T1/T2 below; the rest are doc
edits. **All fifteen settled by W0 (#295)**, each with a stated decision in
[prototype-trackerprog.md](prototype-trackerprog.md): I1 an ordered producer list
per 16-bit target (§4), I2/I15 a stated `commit(v)` order plus `meta.commit_order`
(§3.1, §4), I3 `rate` is a divider everywhere (§3.3), I4 per-voice tempo (§3.6),
I5 `play` gains `vol?`/`tempo?`, I6 `arm(acc_id, overrides)` + `set`/`set_register`
/`set_stream`, I7 deltas are in the target register's units (§3.2), I8 tremolo
targets the gate mask, I9 no `clamp(note)` — the overrun is a producer (§6), I10
`period: 1` is `end.kind = fixed_point`, materialised to `first_repeat` (§2), I11
the three-part `external input` rule (§8), I12 defMON added to §9, I13
`gate.timer` folded into `early` and `set_tempo(stream)`/`scope` re-grounded, I14
the certificate gains `dropped` (§2).

## 4. Work packages

| # | item | mechanism | owner | size | acceptance |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| ~~W0~~ | schema revision of the prototype doc | settle I1–I15 and §2's corrections: per-voice ordered edge list with a stated emit order; `Acc.delta` admits `+ carry(site)`, `repeat(Δ, n)`, `tabcell`, `sext11`; `Acc.phase` may name another `Acc` or a cell or `fn(global_counter)`; `Acc.bound` carries `proved\|projected\|observed` and a projection witness (Commando `hi & $F`); `Acc.target` admits `split(k, 8)` (SW cutoff); `links` for cross-Acc resets (GT2 snap zeroes the vibrato phase); one `rate` meaning; `set_register(reg, v)` or a Follin refusal; a horizon terminator in `Order`; `period: 1` handling; Commando's per-tick input | docs | small | every §2/§3 row cites two certified families or a survey count; the §2 table above empty |
| ~~W1~~ | one observable reduction | `grid.reduce_tick(writes, prev) -> TickObs(edges, values)` + vectorised `reduce_run` over the existing `grid.grid`; constants `CTRL/AD/SR/PAIRS/LEVEL`; `grid.changes` factored out of `ghidra_facts._tick_writes`; `Verifier` gains an opt-in `obs` accumulator after `_compare` (`verify.py:336`). `verify._compare` stays raw — mirror folding, the PW nibble and the cutoff mask must not reach it | grid, verify, ghidra_facts | small (1.5–2 d) | recert 51/51 field-for-field (`compared`, `divergence` untouched); hermetic tests: gate 1→0→1 keeps three ctrl entries, `$D401` double write last-wins, `freq_lo`-only tick carries `prev` hi, PW nibble masked |
| ~~W2~~ | `history.py` | `history(prog, trace, names_doc, calls) -> {name: ndarray(ticks)}` over `Verifier` (`run_init`, then `_one` per tick, promoted to `tick()`), `np.frombuffer(M.m)[idx]`, u16 widening from S6 `u16`; sparse-stride regions sampled by `Region.addrs`; library + `tools/`, **not** a pipeline artefact | history, verify | small (1 d) | hermetic: `counter("INC cnt")` history `[1..8]`, PERIODIC snippet periodic at the cert period, a u16 pair widens; all 51 recert dirs replay with 0 divergences |
| ~~W3~~ | S6 exports T2 needs | serialise `facts.index`, `cellindex`, `idxvar` and the base-pointer relation; name record-split fields `cursor` where `cellindex` says so (`views._named_fields`); `Names.from_dict` | facts, recover, views | small (1.5 d) | the score cursors of GT2/JCH/SW/Commando named `cursor` in S6; recert prints listed line by line where they move |
| ~~W4~~ | T0 provenance | `provenance.py`: roots = `io` stores in `$D400..$D418` **and** stores into `names.image` regions (rekeyed by the flush delta); `(register, voices)` from the store's `lo/hi` envelope (more robust than `cellref.voiced`); backward substitution via `irwalk.single_defs`/`expand` stopping at a named role; leaves named through `cellref.Cells`; `ir.enc` for the expr (add `R16`/`W16` to `_NODES`); `tuneprog.T0.json` per write site with `direct`, `self_update`, `refusal`. Region ids are the presentation view's — carry `(base, size)` | provenance, ir, pipeline | medium (3 d) | every io/image write site of the 42 recert dirs is a named expr or a stated refusal; the record's `print` re-renders to the `tuneprog.md` line |
| ~~W5~~ | T1 `accum.py` | candidates from `facts.cellupd` reaching an io store (W4); `Delta`/`Dir` parser (`idioms.bit`, new `sext11`); a diamond over `Store`/`Call` arms (new — not `gated.diamonds`); the variable-shift loop `x >> cell` recogniser `loops.py` lacks (`tablestep`, GT2 `p_12E5`, Commando `$51E4`); guard walk over dominators → policy; bound from guard (`proved`), projection (`projected`), or history under a period witness (`observed`); two verifiers — interval assertion and **recurrence replay** against W2's history, divergence ⇒ `unclassified update` | accum, idioms, loops | medium–large (5.5–7 d) | hermetic snippet per policy (`wrap reflect-complement reflect-dircell clamp halt reload rate tablestep split`), refusals named with the cell; exemplar regression: GT2 vibrato+porta, Commando bounce+run+porta, JCH pw/cutoff, SW cutoff classified as W0 states |
| W6 | T2 `trackerprog/{cursors,streams,score,pitch,refuse}.py` | cursor × history: successor relation at a fixed base → step/jump edges, rows, loop row, terminator byte, holds; nest through `names.u16` bases (depth ≤ 2 else `score not cursor-shaped`); Follin call/ret/for from the dispatch arms + the depth-1 return slot; `pitch` from `names.freq` + per-accessor origin (Commando reads `FREQ` at two bases); materialise over the horizon. **Blocker**: SW's orderlist load is erased by the copy fold (`p_17C8` prints nothing, `T1C40/T1C4E/T1C5C` have no accessors) — either `copyview` keeps the load or SW refuses | trackerprog | large (8–10 d) | goldens on GT2 (33 pattern ptrs, 9×30 instruments, `T16F9`), JCH (26 ptrs, `rec8[19]`, 3 `$FF`s), Commando (`T576B`, `T5889`, `rec2`); the SW fold produces a named refusal until fixed; recert untouched |
| W7 | universal player + T3 | `trackerprog/{player,emit,certify}.py`: §4 made exact per W0, rendered tick-for-tick; `certify` = W1's `TickObs` equality against `Verifier.obs` over the whole horizon; S4-style tagged JSON, `trackerprog.md`, the certificate with `refusals` and the loop claim | trackerprog | medium (3–4 d) | GT2 ×2, JCH ×2 0 divergences; every refusal names its cell; §6.2's six numbers + `xz -9e` against the source `tuneprog.md` |

**W0 struck by #295**: §2's table settled row by row (two rows corrected here
rather than in the doc — the JCH `rec6`/`rec7` row was wrong, and the 91.6 % row
cited the wrong architecture line); I1–I15 each carry a stated decision; §5's
table re-derived from the exemplar shapes with two-family evidence per row and two
marked single-family exceptions; §7 rewritten as what landed (#291–#294) plus
`accum.py` remaining; §9 gained defMON and separates §6.2's six numbers from `xz`.
`sext(k, T[c])` was **not** added as a delta form — the only sign-extending
accumulator delta over the certified set is SW's filter step, which is
`tabcell(T[c], signed 11)`; `sext` in the IR is a jump offset only
(`sw-emomyst/tuneprog.md:1205`).

**W1 struck by #291**: `grid.regs/changes/reduce_tick/reduce_run` + `TickObs` and
`Verifier(obs=True)` landed; `ghidra_facts._tick_writes` is filter plus
`grid.changes`, `verify._compare` untouched, recert field-for-field on
`gt2-je-suis-linus` and `jch-guldkorn-intro`.

**W2 struck by #292**: `history.cells/history/widen_u16` + `History` sample the
verifier's own ticks (`Verifier._one` promoted to `tick()`), sparse strides off
`Region.addrs`; `tools/tuneprog_history.py` writes `tuneprog.history.npz`, no
artefact moved and recert reproduces. Replayed with 0 divergences:
`gt2-je-suis-linus` 12,000 ticks / 120 cells / 5.4 s, `jch-guldkorn-intro`
4,000 / 146 / 1.6 s, `sw-emomyst` 12,000 / 129 / 8.0 s, `commando-song1`
11,780 / 206 / 3.4 s.

**W3 struck by #293**: `facts.idxbase`/`cellsrc`/`leaf_reads` and one cell key
(`Facts.cell`: the const base of an index address, dropped when the region does
not contain it) put record fields into `cellindex`; `facts.cursor_cells` is the
one cursor rule for scalars, fold slots and split fields alike, ahead of the
update role; `recover.index_relation` serialises the relation as
`tuneprog.S6.json`'s `index` block and `Names.from_dict` reads the whole document
back. Score cursors now carrying the role: GT2 `rec[x/7].cursor` (`+0`, orderlist
position) and `.cursor_2` (`+3`, row cursor) plus `.cursor_3` (`+5`); JCH
`voice_3[v].cursor` (`+9`, row cursor) and `voice_2[x].cursor`/`.cursor_2`;
SID Wizard `rec` `+0`/`+2`/`+3`/`+4`/`+5`/`+6`; Commando unchanged, its cursors
were already scalars. Recert 4/4 field-for-field, `tuneprog.py` byte-identical;
the only moved print lines are field names.

**W4 struck by #294**: `provenance.py` writes `tuneprog.T0.json` beside S6 —
`{plane, voice_map, image, writes}`, one record per SID write site of the printed
program. Roots are the `io` stores whose envelope lies in `$D400..$D418` and the
stores into a `sid_image` region rekeyed by the flush delta, each carrying the
flush site's pc; `provenance.regvoices` reads the register off the site's base
and the voices off its envelope, which names SID Wizard's opaque
`sid.reg[saved10]` (`freq_lo`, voices 0–2) where `cellref.voiced` gives nothing.
A span no voice stride makes is `kind: file` where one value covers every
register in it (the GT2 flush `sid.reg[v] = ghost.reg[v]`, the JCH/SW
`sid.reg[v] = 0` clears) and a refusal otherwise. `expr` substitutes names
stopping at every cell S6 names, serialised with `ir.enc` — which gained
`R16`/`W16` in `_NODES` — and `W16` gained `env`, the low half's own envelope,
the one thing the 16-bit fold used to drop. Each record re-enters the printer
state its site printed in, so `cells` spell as the print spells them and `print`
is the line of `tuneprog.md` itself.

| tune | sites | direct | image | file | refusals | `print` round-trip | registers |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | --- | --- | --- |
| `gt2-je-suis-linus` | 22 | 1 | 21 | 1 | none | 22/22 | 11, `freq` pairs included; 7 self-updating |
| `jch-guldkorn-intro` | 15 | 15 | 0 | 1 | none | 15/15 | 8, `freq`/`pw` as pairs |
| `sw-emomyst` | 17 | 17 | 0 | 1 | none | 17/17 | 11 |
| `commando-song1` | 27 | 27 | 0 | 0 | none | 27/27 | 9 |

Over all 51 recert S4 programs: **849 write sites, 849 prints re-rendering to
their own `tuneprog.md` line, 0 sites both unnamed and unrefused**. The 40
refusals are the two shapes the envelope cannot read — 36 `index not a voice`
(Follin's raw cross-voice register list `sid.reg[a75] = …` over `$D405..$D418`,
JCH's `sid.reg[v] = t1` clear at a non-constant value) and 4 `smc target`
(Baumrucker's and Follin's patched store operands, `io[b6200[5] + x2]`), each
naming its own cell. Recert 4/4 field-for-field; S5/S6/`tuneprog.md` regenerate
byte-identical to `main`'s over the same four S4 programs, and the T0 render
leaves the view untouched for the print that follows it.

**W5 struck by #296**: `accum.document` writes **`tuneprog.T1.json`** —
`{plane, horizon, accs, refusals}` — beside T0, from a library and
`tools/tuneprog_accum.py`; no pipeline artefact moves and recert reproduces 4/4.
Five modules, each under 500 lines: `accshape` (a store's guards as its
transitively closed **control dependences**, not its dominators — the bug that
made a join's block look guarded — plus the callers' arguments where a value's
free names are its procedure's parameters, the additive spine, and the
variable-shift loop `loops.repeats` refuses), `accdelta` (§5's grammar),
`accrule` (counters, bound candidates, policy, rate, phase, scope), `acchist`
(a named-cell expression over `history.py`, the interval assertion and the
recurrence replay) and `accum` (candidates, the split join, the records).

Two seeds were widened where their own limits hid an exemplar: `facts.cellupd`
is block-local and capped at two operators, which hides SID Wizard's
`cutoff_lo = ((t3 & 7) + cutoff_lo) & 7` and Hubbard's saved-register store, so
T1 scans the sites itself over proc-wide definitions; and `pipeline.present` is
**not deterministic** — the view's block order varies run to run — so every
enumeration T1 makes is sorted by tick rank and pc, which makes its output
stable (verified over four runs per tune).

| tune | ticks | accs (policy / `bound.from`) | refusals | s |
| --- | ---: | --- | --- | ---: |
| `gt2-je-suis-linus` | 12,000 | 4: vibrato phase `reflect-complement`/`observed`; vibrato and portamento freq `reflect`/`observed`, `tablestep`, the first `phase acc(id)`; filter `wrap`/`observed` `tabcell` | 3 `delta`, 1 `replay` | 7.2 |
| `jch-guldkorn-intro` | 4,000 | 2: slide and vibrato freq `wrap`/`projected`, `field`, scope voice | 3 `replay` | 2.2 |
| `sw-emomyst` | 12,000 | 4: filter `split(3, 8)` ×2 `wrap`/`observed` `tabcell` signed 11; `sid.reg` `clamp`/`projected` and `wrap`/`observed` | 4 `delta`, 1 `replay` | 10.4 |
| `commando-song1` | 11,780 | 0 | 3 `replay` | 3.9 |

**10 accumulators, 0 replay divergences, 0 interval escapes, 15 refusals**, each
naming its cell, its site and the §5 clause it failed. Hubbard refused at its
full horizon: the tick that both reloads a segment and steps it, and the arms
whose carry a call return supplies, left moves the plane could not make, and
fail-closed is the design. Hermetic tests cover `wrap`, `reflect-complement`,
`reflect` on a direction cell, `clamp` with a `links` reset, `halt`, `reload`
with a `$FF` sentinel and a countdown `rate`, `tablestep`, the 16-bit carry join
and the `unclassified update` refusal; the `hvsc` set runs T1 over
`pipeline.main` tmpdirs for all four families.

**The W5 gap closed by #297.** Six rules, each with two families, land in
[prototype-trackerprog.md](prototype-trackerprog.md) §5: reverse postorder as the
tick's own statement order (so a reload and the step that follows it are one
move, not two readings of one), `+ carry(site, flag)` for a bit another block of
the tick leaves and a refusal for one the tick is *given*, a loop's exit test
dropped from the guards of the body that precedes it, both epochs of a cell the
tick moved read for every condition, and a copy loop's scratch opened to the one
expression that fills it. `accshape` split at 500 lines: `accguard` now holds
`key_of`, the control dependences, `opened`, the scratch set and its propagation;
`graph.rpo` is the one reverse postorder. §5 also corrects a fifth row — a
direction cell the *score* sets is the free slide (`wrap`), and only one the play
turns is `reflect`.

| tune | ticks | #296 accs (policy/`bound.from`) | #297 accs | #296 refusals | #297 refusals |

GoatTracker 2's only change is the policy correction (its slide's direction is
the command byte the score writes, §5 row 5); SID Wizard is field-for-field.
JCH's pulse and cutoff are `reload` streams of segments with a `tabcell` delta
and a countdown `rate`, and nothing of that tune refuses. Hubbard's portamento is
`wrap`, `field(b5520 & $7E)`, `phase bit(b5520, 0)`, scope voice; its pulse run is
`wrap`, `tabcell(rec2[voice[].cursor_54FE].b5597) + carry($5240, C#41)`, scope
instrument. Its one refusal is `acc_2_lo`, whose **value cell is copy-loop
scratch**: `$550A` is one column that p_519B rewrites once per voice inside
`oscillator`'s `for v in 2, 1, 0`, so a once-a-tick history holds the last voice's
value and cannot take the three apart — the refusal carries `scratch: true` and
its site. Over the certified 1,200-tick `hvsc` horizon the same cell *does*
classify (`repeat(tablestep(FREQ, voice[].freq_idx, timer_3), b550C)`, 0
divergences), which is what the exemplar test pins. The pulse **bounce** is not a
second Acc: both arms park their result in one `saved` name that neither
dominates, so the record carries it as an unnamed producer of the same cell.
Hermetic tests added: reload-then-step in one tick with the rank order asserted,
`graph.rpo` against the CFG, a carry another block defines (accepted, flag
`C#1`) and one the tick is given (refused, flag `C`). Recert 4/4 reproduced, no
artefact moved, T1 byte-stable over four runs under `PYTHONHASHSEED=random`.

Total ≈ 24–30 agent-days. W1–W3 are independent of W0 and of each other;
W4 depends on W3; W5 on W0, W2, W4; W6 on W0, W2, W3; W7 on all.

## 5. Execution order

1. **W1 + W2 + W3** in parallel — small, recert-neutral, each its own PR.
2. **W0** — the doc revision, reviewed against §2/§3 above; it fixes the
   `Acc` and `Cmd` shapes W5/W6 build to.
3. ~~**W4**~~, then ~~**W5**~~, and **W6** (W6 on GT2/JCH/Commando; SW gated on
   the fold fix).
4. **W7** on GT2 ×2, JCH ×2; then SW ×2 after the fold, Commando ×2 after
   W0 settles I1/I11, Follin after I6.

Deliberately not now: Galway/Walker/Blackbird (uncertified — the anatomy
describes them, no certificate covers them), multispeed (§10). **Not** defMON:
that line was wrong. defMON is certified four times over — `automatas`,
`automatas-6581`, `automatas-8580` (149,025 ticks, period 129,024, `complete`)
and `goto80-jazzpjazz` (1,799 ticks, `horizon`), architecture §9.2 — with recert
dirs for all four and its own [prototype-automatas.md](prototype-automatas.md).
W0 puts it in the acceptance list.
