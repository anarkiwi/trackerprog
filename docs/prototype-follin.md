# Prototype: the tuneprog decompiler on Tim Follin's *Ghouls'n'Ghosts*

The second exemplar of [tuneprog-decompiler-design.md](tuneprog-decompiler-design.md),
after defMON's *Automatas* ([prototype-automatas.md](prototype-automatas.md)):
`MUSICIANS/F/Follin_Tim/Ghouls_n_Ghosts.sid` (anatomy [§3.6](playroutine-anatomy.md)),
32 subtunes, three unrolled voice interpreters, a 21-way patched-`JMP` dispatch,
and a rip loader whose `init` patches its own compare. Every subtune is certified
(`docs/certificates/ghouls-song01.json` … `-song32.json`, plus
`ghouls-songs-all.json` for the union program). No Follin-specific code path
exists; Automatas, Commando and SID Wizard's Emomyst certify with the same
pipeline.

## 1. Why Follin

| design mechanism | how Ghouls'n'Ghosts stresses it |
|---|---|
| SMC operand cells (S2) | 24 varying sites: 21 immediates used as variables, 3 dispatch `JMP` operands — **and `init` patches the same cells**, plus one of its own (`$29D8`) between two copy loops |
| computed control (S2) | `LDA T1,X; STA $6375; LDA T2,X; STA $6376; JMP $xxxx`, X = command byte ≥ $80, tables at `base−$80`, three voice copies |
| computed store (S2/S3) | `LDA $622E,X; STA $6219` then a store *through* the patched operand into one of three unequally-spaced cells |
| data-dependent SID address (§7 traps) | `$85` writes `STA $D400,X` with X from the song: the register is a variable |
| per-subtune init images (S0/S3) | 32 subtunes; `init` tail-jumps into a rip stub that copies two song blocks over itself, then either starts a song or a sound effect |
| return value (§6.2) | `play` returns `A = $7B \| $7C \| $7D` — `$FF` while any voice runs, 0 when all three stop |
| copy folding, table typing (S6) | three 493-byte voice templates plus three handler copies, chained by `JMP` inside one procedure, each with its own 21-way switch; a 97-entry note table the transpose can index past, into the SFX tables |
| structuring (S5) | the whole frame is **one linear procedure**: no `JSR` on the hot path, voice *n* ends by `JMP` to voice *n*+1, handlers `JMP` back into their voice's sequencer |

---

## 2. Ground truth (anatomy §3.6, measured against the trace)

| fact | value |
|---|---|
| container | PSID v2, load $2980–$733F, init $6110 (A = subtune), play $6234, 32 subtunes, PAL, one call per frame (19,656 cycles), no CIA, no IRQ installed |
| subtunes | 0–10 music (0–5 end with a stop, 6–10 loop), 11–31 sound effects; HVSC lengths 259.3, 102, 12.5, 10, 4, 127, 171.1, 147.5, 138.3, 113, 170.1 s then 0.1–13 s |
| player | $6110–$6CB6 code; voices $6234/$6421/$6610 (493 B each, identical modulo ZP operands +1/+2 and one `CMP #v` insertion at $65C7/$67B6); filter $67FF; 21 handlers × 3 at $6858–$6CB6 |
| state | zero page $21–$97: stride 1 for bytes, stride 2 for the pointer/word pairs; `init` clears it with one `STA $21,X` loop, so the access relation makes it **one 118-byte region** (`b0021` in the print) |
| SMC cells | pulse mode $62EE/$64DB/$66CA, vib dir $6269/$6456/$6645, trill phase $629E/$648B/$667A, fixed length $640F/$65FE/$67ED, filter dir $6800 and bounds $6813/$6819/$682D/$6833, dispatch $6375/$6562/$6751 (2 B each), the SFX store operand $6219, the loader's `CPY #` at $29D8 |
| inputs | none volatile: no `$D012`, `$D41B`, timer or VIC read anywhere |
| SID schedule | voice 0 → 1 → 2 → filter; `$D415`/`$D416` every frame; `init` writes $08 then $00 to `$D400–$D41C` (four writes past the last register) |
| traps present | table overrun (note + transpose past 97 entries), tables at `base−$80`, a store whose address is data, a `BPL` whose own operand byte the block copy overwrites, `LDA #v; BNE` made conditional by SMC, `INC/DEC` floor idiom, frame-count durations with no tempo |

---

## 3. What broke, and the generic fix

**The envelope trap in `init`.** The rip loader at `$2980` copies two song blocks
per subtune and patches the operand of its own `CPY #$00` at `$29D7` with `STY
$29D8` — once per block, consumed *inside* `init*, with a different value each
time. The front end keyed sites by `(pc, opcode, fixed operand bytes)` with only
*play*-written cells blanked, so the site took the post-init byte (the second
block's remainder) and the first copy loop overran by one byte: `$4622 outside
[$3D44,$4621]` at `$29DB`.

The rule is now the design's without the phase qualifier: **an instruction byte
any traced procedure writes, in any phase, is a variable** (`trace.py`: `cells =
code & (written_init | written_play)`) — it drops out of the site key and the lift
loads it, so one site serves both loops.

**Putting the constants back.** Residualising every init-patched operand would
cost SID Wizard its readable tick (Emomyst's `init` relocates the player and
patches ~30 operands). `ssa.Folds` folds a load at a known address to the
post-init byte when at least one of its bytes is an SMC cell and none is
play-written, and `ssa.simplify` applies it only in the procedures `init` never
reaches — inside `init` the value is the store's, not the image's. An ordinary
init-written *variable* is not a cell, so it keeps its load and its name; a
`--songs all` build folds nothing at all.

**A patched conditional branch keeps its condition.** The rip stub's `BPL` at
`$7318` sits in the band its own block copy overwrites, so its offset byte is a
cell and the branch became a bare computed `switch` — which evaluated the *taken*
target on a call that fell through (`trap 'switch'`). `cfg.py` now emits
`if cond: switch(target) else: fall-through`, with the taken side's observed
targets in the switch (`build._branch_switch`).

**Presentation** (`pseudocode.py`, no IR change): a SID store whose index does not
step by the 7-byte voice block prints as `sid.reg[i]`, because the *register* is
what the index selects (`$85`, and every `LDY #$1C` clear loop); a table's
literal operand moves into the index, so `LDA $6C37,X` on a region based at
`$6CB7` prints `T6CB7[cmd - $80]`; and a play entry's `A` prints as the tick's
`return` when every exit agrees on one computed expression (`ir.retval`).

**Sibling closure and the fold** (`siblings.py`, `closure.py`, `copyfold.py`,
`views.py`; S2c/S6, presentation only). The three voices are three copies of one
static template, and the alignment of their instruction streams recovers that
from the post-init image: equal opcodes advance all three, and a gap holds the
`CMP #v` voices 1 and 2 carry where voice 0 uses the load's own Z flag.
The dispatch is where the copies stop being one stream, so its arms are paired in
table order by how far their targets align, which carries the correspondence into
the handlers. *Amended by #241:* discovery is exact -- the bases are the chain the
built procedures already carry, each pair of copies is one `difflib` alignment in
which only a gap may separate them, and the family holds only while every copy's
operand map is a function (an indexed base whose index is data, `STA $D400,X`,
names something else than the same literal under `abs`); the ten thresholds are
gone and song 1's family is the same three voices over 419 rows. Each copy then gets the arms its siblings ran -- the same site,
under that copy's own operands, with count 0 and reachable only through edges that
were a `trap` before -- and the front end builds a second program from the closed
trace. That program's copies are one program modulo a renaming, so it prints once
over `for v in 0, 1, 2`, with a group view whose fields are a per-copy address
table rather than a stride (section 5). The certified S4 program, its Python and
its certificate are the trace-closed ones either way; `--closure none` prints
them.

**Static jump-table arms** (`jumptab.py`): when both halves of a patched `JMP`
operand are copied from constant tables indexed by one value, the table's
remaining entries are targets too, and become arms that `trap 'unverified'`
instead of a bare default.

**`--songs all`** (should-have): `tracedata.merge` builds one trace from every
subtune — sites re-keyed by the union of their cells (a wider cell set can only
merge keys, never split them), edges/calls/returns/written sets unioned, each
subtune's write log left where verification needs it. What `init` writes is typed
`state` and nothing folds; every subtune is then verified against its own trace.

## 4. Evidence (measured, song 1 unless stated)

| # | claim | measured |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | patched-`JMP` dispatch becomes a switch | three switches on `load16($6375/$6562/$6751)`, **21/23/23 arms** (14/18/15 observed, the rest statically enumerated as `trap 'unverified'`) — the commands the tables carry, `$93`/`$94` included since the SID Wizard pass made a table run out to the nearest instruction or foreign access rather than stopping at the bytes an accessor touched (two of the 23 are that rule over-reaching past the 21-entry table) |
| 2 | data-dependent SID address | `sid.reg[a327] = b730E[...]` inside the `$85` list loop; the write's envelope is `$D400–$D418`, and `(addr, val)` equality is part of the certificate |
| 3 | computed store operand | in the SFX subtunes' `init`: a store **through** `load16($6219)` whose region is `[$640F, $67ED]` — exactly the three voices' fixed-length cells (song 16) |
| 4 | 32 subtunes from the pre-init image | all 32 certified, 0 divergences, 0 envelope traps; 31 complete via a period (§6) |
| 5 | play returns a value | `return ((b0021[90] \| b0021[91]) \| b0021[92])` = `$7B \| $7C \| $7D`; not part of the certificate |
| 6 | three unrolled voices fold | **yes, once the siblings are closed**: the copies ran 188/211/199 of a 229-offset template (163 common), so the trace-closed programs differ in shape before any operand does; of the 420 aligned rows the copies executed 308/380/329, and the closure lifts 189 sites so that all three have the same 402 (the 18 left are rows no copy ever reached, so no sibling can donate them). One family, one loop, 44 of 283 printed statements unverified; the whole document goes from 1,421 lines to 666 |
| 7 | SMC immediates as variables | 35 cells (24 play-written, 11 init-patched); every play-written cell is a load at its instruction, every init-only cell is a constant in the tick and a store in `init`; 76 cells in the `--songs all` build |
| 8 | `init` writes $08 then $00 to `$D400–$D41C` | 58 init writes, `$D41C` down to `$D400`, values `{8, 0}` — compared byte for byte by the certificate |
| - | genericity, budget | Automatas (149,025 calls, period 129,024, both SID models), Commando songs 1–2, Emomyst at 10 s: 0 divergences with the same code. Song 1 is traced and verified in one 14 s invocation: 1,177 sites → 68 regions → 4 procedures → 1,242 statements |

---

## 5. The printed `tick()` (`tuneprog.md`, verbatim; `...` elides)

One loop over the three voices, the 21-way command switch inside it, and every
per-voice cell a field of a group whose per-copy addresses the state header lists
once -- including the SMC cells no stride describes (`$62EE`/`$64DB`/`$66CA`).

```

Where a voice ends its own note the arm now reads `continue`, not `goto L6421_A5`:
the chain edge into the next copy is the loop's back edge. What is left of
`b0021[...]` is the filter's own cells and `$74`, the voice number -- the parts of
the zero-page block that are not per-voice at all.

## 6. Certificates

`docs/certificates/ghouls-songNN.json`, from `tools/tuneprog_certify.py … --song N
--until-period --seconds S --budget 45 --resume` (music: 2.4 × the HVSC length +
20 s, covering the transient plus one loop; effects: 400 s). All 32: **0
divergences, 0 envelope traps**.

| subtune | ticks | s | period | complete |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1–6 (music, end with a stop) | 12,997 / 5,116 / 626 / 503 / 200 / 6,542 | 259 / 102 / 12 / 10 / 4 / 130 | 1 | yes — the state reaches a fixpoint |
| 7–11 (music, loop) | 14,337 / 12,671 / 13,093 / 9,121 / 13,280 | 286 / 253 / 261 / 182 / 265 | 8,064 / 7,392 / 6,930 / 5,664 / 6,799 | yes — a repeat after one loop |
| 12–20, 22–32 (effects) | 6–1,265 | 0.1–25 | 1 (617 for 22, 505 for 31) | yes |
| 21 (effect) | 20,049 | 400 | none | no — horizon only |

`ghouls-songs-all.json`: one tuneprog (1,442 sites, 75 regions, 1,567 statements)
from the union of all 32 traces, verified subtune by subtune — 220,049 calls,
0 divergences, 31 of 32 complete.

All 33 were re-run after the SID Wizard pass changed how far a jump table
reaches ([prototype-sidwizard.md](prototype-sidwizard.md) §3): every certified
result — ticks, periods, completeness, 0 divergences — is unchanged, and only the
`ir_blocks` count moves, by the arms the new extent adds (and the ones below a
table's base it no longer invents).

Automatas (`automatas.json`, `-6581`, `-8580`) and Commando (`commando-song1/2`)
were re-run on the new front end and come out *byte-identical* apart from the
timestamp — same 651 sites, 102 regions, 1,070 statements, same period 129,024 at
call 149,024 — so the committed files stand.

## 7. What remains

Two of the four obstacles this section used to list are gone. **The three voice
copies fold** (§3, §4 row 6, §5): the closure gives every copy the arms its
siblings ran, and `copyfold` proves the copies one program modulo a renaming --
equal alpha-renamed skeletons, every differing address consistent with one
per-copy mapping, every other differing constant affine in the index. The
unequally spaced SMC cells (`$62EE`/`$64DB`/`$66CA`) are that mapping, listed once
in the state header; the `goto`s to per-voice labels became one label per arm and
the chain edge into the next voice became `continue`.

- **The closure's arms are unverified.** 189 of the closed program's sites are a
  sibling's, lifted under this copy's operands: reachable only through edges that
  were a `trap`, count 0, and part of a program the same front end builds from the
  closed trace -- but no execution took them. 44 of the 283 printed statements are
  theirs, and the `closure` line says so. The certified S4 program is the
  trace-closed one, and `--closure none` prints it (1,421 lines, three copies).
- **What is left of the zero page is what is not per-voice.** `$21–$97` is still
  one region -- init clears it with one loop -- but the fold names 51 of its cells
  by their per-copy address table, so what still prints as `b0021[...]` is the
  filter's own accumulator and bounds and `$74`, the voice number. A stride view
  cannot split the rest: those cells are reached by constant addresses, not by an
  index, so there is nothing for `views.field_split` to key on.
- **Three of the 21 arms are still `trap 'unverified'`,** and the folded switch
  is copy 0's. The dispatch's arms pair in table order by how far their targets
  align, which closes every arm some voice sent (18 of 21); the three no voice
  sent have no donor. The two entries per copy past the 21-entry table (the
  extent rule over-reaching, §4 row 1) pair with nothing and are left out of the
  shape, so the printed switch has copy 0's 21 arms rather than copy 1's 23.
- **The music subtunes fold; most of the effects do not.** Songs 1–11, 16 and 20
  fold their three voices (1–61 unverified statements of 99–283). A sound effect
  uses one or two voices, so the copy that runs nothing never reaches its
  dispatch, its arms have nothing to pair with, and the handler bodies the other
  copies ran stay outside the copies -- a cross-copy edge, which the fold
  refuses.
- **The `--songs all` union does not fold.** One voice's stream read is access
  class `chk` where the others' are `ram`: over 32 subtunes that voice reaches
  bytes outside the written set, and a load of a different class is a different
  program. The union's closure still lifts 9 sites.
- **Subtune 21** is the one subtune with no state repeat inside 400 s: two voices
  keep a portamento and a trill moving (`$66/$67` note index, `$75/$78` frequency
  shadow, `$648B` trill phase) and the write list has no period either (317
  distinct lists over 20,049 calls). Certified to the horizon.
- **16-bit views** do not reach the frequency shadow (`$75/$78`) or the pulse
  width (`$3F/$40`) — `word.fold16` proves a pair from one carry chain, and these
  halves are stored by different instructions — and the filter's `hi:lo` to
  `$D416` shift chain prints as its shifts.
