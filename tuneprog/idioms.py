"""S4 peepholes on the SSA form: 6510 idioms become ordinary expressions.

Two rewrites, both semantics-preserving and both re-verified against
:class:`~.ir.Interp`:

* :func:`inline` folds a pure single-use value into its use *inside one block*,
  which is what puts a flag's defining expression under the branch that reads it
  (after :func:`~.ssa.merge_chains` a compare and its branch share a block);
* :func:`fold` then simplifies algebraically -- constants, masks
  (``(x & $7F) & $80`` -> 0, so ``ANC #$7F``'s carry disappears), boolean
  comparisons (``(x == y) == 1`` -> ``x == y``, ``(x == y) == 0`` -> ``x != y``)
  and the 6510's compare shape ``((x - y) & $FF) == 0`` -> ``x == y``, which
  turns compare-then-branch, ``DEC``/``INC``-then-branch and the ``ASL``/``BIT``
  bit tests into relational tests over the values themselves.

``LAX``/``SAX``/``SBX``/``ALR``/``ANC`` need no rule of their own: the lifter
already expands them into the same value algebra, and the two rewrites above
reduce them with everything else.

:func:`compound_hints` reports the load-modify-store shapes on a single scalar
region (``x = x + 1`` on one address) for the printer; it does not change the IR.

Public API: :func:`rewrite` (the pass :func:`~.ssa.simplify` calls),
:func:`inline`, :func:`fold`, :func:`compound_hints`.
