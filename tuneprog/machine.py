"""S0 -- machine image, entry/cadence discovery, init runner, 6510 port and CIA models.

Public API:

* ``MachineImage.from_sid(data)`` -- 64 KiB pre-init image (power-on RAM overlaid
  with the load band) plus the header facts a driver needs.
* ``find_entries(data, mem=None, written=None, song=None)`` -- ``(MachineImage,
  [Entry(kind, addr, cycles_per_tick, source, kernal)])``; raises :class:`Refusal`.
* ``shared_entry(data, songs)`` -- the one entry every subtune shares, else a
  :class:`Refusal`.
* ``entry_frame(entry)`` / ``frame_slots(entry)`` -- what the machine pushed below
  the return address entering it, and the slot each byte sits at.
* ``init_runner(vm, pc, cache, lifter, budget)`` -- run ``init`` to its balancing
  RTS or to a ``JMP *`` idle loop; returns the idle pc or ``None``.
* ``port_bank(mem)`` / ``kernal_mapped(mem)`` -- what the 6510 port ($00
  direction, $01 data) maps at ``$D000-$DFFF`` and at ``$E000-$FFFF``.
* ``vector_gate(mem, written, img)`` -- which installed interrupt vector that
  port really dispatches through; raises :class:`Refusal` when none does.
* ``nmi_gate(cia2, cycles, reason)`` -- refuses when CIA #2 has raised an NMI.
* ``CIA(base)`` -- minimal Timer-A/ICR model (count-down at cycle rate, ICR bit on
  underflow) so an init busy-wait on ``$DC04``/``$DC0D`` terminates.
