"""L5 -- instruction selection: a run of predicated rows covered by constructs.

BURS-style covering against :mod:`.expand`'s expansions with a size cost.  A run
of rows a construct expands to *and* that costs more than the construct is that
construct; the run selection does not cover stays as guarded rows -- the
residual.  Reading a construct back out of a run is the inverse of the
expansion, so the two are checked against each other over every construct of
every certified build (``tests/trackerprog/test_l5_roundtrip.py``).
