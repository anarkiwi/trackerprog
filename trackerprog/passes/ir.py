"""The level object the passes hand each other, and the validation between them.

L0 and L1 are the S4 IR with the facts the structuring derived; L2 to L6 are
trackerprogs, which :mod:`..universal` renders.  ``validate`` renders the level
before a pass and the level after it and asserts the write lists agree -- raw,
where both are the player's, and by the certificate's own reduction where the
comparison crosses from the interpreter to the player (section 2 drops the
interleave between voices of one tick's writes, and only that).
