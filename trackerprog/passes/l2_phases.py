"""L2 -- phase-normal form: the voice's pass cut into phases of predicated rows.

Region formation and if-conversion.  The voice body is cut at the fetch regions
and at the edge writes; each segment is one ``{stream}`` phase of ``meta.tick``
whose rows are that segment's blocks under the guard path each stands on, and a
``commit`` stands where a segment ended a group.  The blocks outside the voice
loop are the tick's own pre and post lists, and the register file every write
lands in is the tick's first phase, its flush.  The result is a trackerprog --
the most general the schema has, a guarded ``all: True`` row list at every
phase -- which the unchanged player renders.
